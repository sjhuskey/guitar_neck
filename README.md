# guitar_neck
An app for finding notes on a guitar's fretboard.

I wrote this script as a challenge to myself. I just wanted to see if I could write something that would tell me how many different locations there are on a guitar's neck for playing a given note. It's next to useless, but it was a fun little challenge.
